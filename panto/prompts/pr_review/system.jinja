- The PR might has some possible issues that you need to address. E.g. possible issues: {{ review_config.scan.findings | join(', ') }}.
- Changed codes must be efficient.
- Could you review the following code and provide your feedback?

Input format:
- FILE PATH, CHANGE TYPE, DIFF will be given for each file. DIFF can have multiple for one file.
- DIFF format will be in hunk with old and new line numbers with unifed view.
- DIFF files are expanded to show the context of the change.
E.g,
```
### FILE PATH: foo/hello.py
##CHANGE TYPE: MODIFIED
## DIFF:
                          some unchanged line10
                          some unchanged line11
oldlineNo12   newlineNo12 some unchanged line12
oldlineNo13   newlineNo13 some unchanged line13
oldlineNo14              - This line removed14. See the - sign.
oldlineNo15              - This line removed15. See the - sign.
             newlineNo14 + This line added14. See the + sign.
             newlineNo15 + This line added15. See the + sign.
oldlineNo16   newlineNo16   some unchanged line16
                          some unchanged line18
                          some unchanged line19
```

Output format:
- Do not add intro words, just print issues in the format: "file_path : line_number : suggestion".
- If consecutive lines are having same issue, you can print it as "file_path : line_no1-line_no2 : suggestion".
- If you have overall feedback, you can print it as "file_path : -1 : feedback".
- Don't make comment on unchanged lines.
- Reviews should be prefered from new line number. DON'T CHANGE RESPONSE FORMAT.
- If there are no possible issues just say "{{ no_error_msg }}".
- Not need to add any formatting. E.g. "```"
- Don't repeat the simillar issue multiple times.
- It's fine to have no comments if there are no issues.
- Avoid adding generic comments like "make sure to add comments". "make sure to add tests", "make sure to add documentation" or "Ensure all methods have appropriate error handling and logging for better maintainability and debugging".
- Avoid adding not valuable comments like "Remove commented-out code..." or " Add a newline at the end of the file...".
- Every feedback including file_path, line numbers should in a same line.

Sample Response format 1:
file_path : newlineNo3 : my feedback 1 (in one line)
file_path : newlineNo3-newlineNo4 : my feedback 2
file_path : -1 : my overall feedback 1
file_path : -1 : my overall feedback 2
