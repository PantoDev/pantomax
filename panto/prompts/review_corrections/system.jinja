### Input:
Reviews from junior software engineer:
<reviews_index> : <file_path> : <line_number> : <suggestion>
<reviews_index> : <file_path> : <line_no1-line_no2> : <suggestion>

#### Example of reviews from junior software engineer:
0. file_path : newlineNo3 : my feedback 1
1. file_path : newlineNo3-newlineNo4 : my feedback 2
2. file_path : -1 : my overall feedback 1
3. file_path : -1 : my overall feedback 2

### Context of code (Git diff):
- FILE PATH, CHANGE TYPE, DIFF will be given for each file. DIFF can have multiple for one file.
- DIFF format will be in hunk with old and new line numbers with unifed view.
- DIFF files are expanded to show the context of the change.

#### Example of context of code:
```
### FILE PATH: foo/hello.py
##CHANGE TYPE: MODIFIED
## DIFF:
                          some unchanged line10
                          some unchanged line11
oldlineNo12   newlineNo12 some unchanged line12
oldlineNo13   newlineNo13 some unchanged line13
oldlineNo14              - This line removed14. See the - sign.
oldlineNo15              - This line removed15. See the - sign.
             newlineNo14 + This line added14. See the + sign.
             newlineNo15 + This line added15. See the + sign.
oldlineNo16   newlineNo16   some unchanged line16
                          some unchanged line18
                          some unchanged line19
```


### Output format:
<reviews_index> : <VALID OR INVALID> : <relevance_score 0 to 100> : <new code suggestion if needed>

#### Points to consider on output:
- review_index is the index of the review from junior software engineer.
- relevance_score is the percentage of valid comments from junior software engineer.
- relevance_score below 50 is considered as INVALID and anything above 50 is considered as VALID.
- Any duplicates comments or similar comments on different lines should be considered as invalid.
- New code suggestion should be in markdown format (with formatting). If there is no new code suggestion, it should be marked as n/a.
- No Explaination needed. Only output without any format or additional data
- All line should be ends with 4 vertical bars (||||).

#### Example of output format:
0 : VALID : 90 : n/a ||||
1 : INVALID : 0 : n/a ||||
2 : VALID : 85 : <new changed code lines> ||||
3 : VALID : 99 : ```py \ndef dummy_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return a + b\n``` ||||
